/* To implement a function that decodes a given encoded string following the format k[encoded_string], 
where encoded_string is repeated k times. The function should handle valid inputs with well-formed 
square brackets and return the fully decoded string. */


/* Example 2:
Input:
s= "3[a2[c]]"

Output:
accaccacc

Explanation:
The string can be decoded by first decoding "a2[c]" to "acc", and then repeating that three times. */
