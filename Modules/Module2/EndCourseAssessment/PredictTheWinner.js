/* To determine if Player 1 can win a game by selecting numbers from either end of an integer array, 
given both players play optimally. The function should return true if Player 1 can achieve a 
score greater than or equal to Player 2's score after all elements are picked. */


/* Example 2:
Input:
[1,5,233,7]

Output:
true

Explanation:
Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 has to choose between 5 and 7. 
No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233. Finally, 
player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to return 
True representing player1 can win. */
