/* To determine the minimum non-zero product of an array formed by integers from 1 to ùëù, p while 
considering the potential swaps of bits in binary representations. The goal is to compute the product 
of the elements in the modified array and return it modulo 10^9 + 7. 
This involves analyzing the effects of bit manipulation on the product and efficiently 
calculating the result. */

/* Example 3:
Input:
3

Output:
1512

Explanation:
nums = [001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111]

In the first operation we can swap the leftmost bit of the second and fifth elements.
The resulting array is [001, 110, 011, 100, 001, 110, 111].
In the second operation we can swap the middle bit of the third and fourth elements.
The resulting array is [001, 110, 001, 110, 001, 110, 111]. 
The array product is 1 * 6 * 1 * 6 * 1 * 6 * 7 = 1512, which is the minimum possible product. */
