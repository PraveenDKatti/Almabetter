/* To determine the number of movement configurations for monkeys on a regular convex polygon that 
result in at least one collision, where monkeys move to neighboring vertices. 
The result should be returned modulo 10^9 + 7. */

/* Example 1:
Input:
3

Output:
6

Explanation:
There are 8 total possible movements. Two ways such that they collide at some point are:
Monkey 1 moves in a clockwise direction; monkey 2 moves in an anticlockwise direction; 
monkey 3 moves in a clockwise direction. Monkeys 1 and 2 collide.
Monkey 1 moves in an anticlockwise direction; monkey 2 moves in an anticlockwise direction; 
monkey 3 moves in a clockwise direction. Monkeys 1 and 3 collide. 
It can be shown 6 total movements result in a collision. */
