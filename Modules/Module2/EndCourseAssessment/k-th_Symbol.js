/* To find the k-th symbol in the n-th row of a sequence generated by transforming binary symbols. 
The transformation rules involve replacing 0 with 01 and 1 with 10 iteratively. */

/* Example 2:
Input:
n = 2, k = 1

Output:
0

Explanation:
The second row is 01, so the first symbol is 0.
row 1: 0 row 2: 01 */
