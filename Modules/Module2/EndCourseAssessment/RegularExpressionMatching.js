/* To implement a function that checks if a given string matches a specified pattern using special 
characters like . (matching any single character) and * (matching zero or more of the preceding element).
The function should accurately identify valid matches based on these criteria. */

/* Example 2:
Input:
s = "aa", p = "a*"

Output:
true

Explanation:
'*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa". */
