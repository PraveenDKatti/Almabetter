/* Determine the maximum sum of a subset of integers from a given array such that the sum is 
divisible by three, using an efficient approach to evaluate possible combinations. */

/* Example 1:
Input:
nums = [3,6,5,1,8]

Output:
18

Explanation:
Pick numbers 3, 6, 1 and 8 their sum is 18 (maximum sum divisible by 3). */
