/* write a Javascript function that returns array of common elements of two arrays, 
including duplicates, based on their frequency in both arrays. */

/* Example 2:
Input:
nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]

Output:
[4,9]

Explanation:
Both 4 and 9 appear in both arrays, so they are included in the intersection. */
