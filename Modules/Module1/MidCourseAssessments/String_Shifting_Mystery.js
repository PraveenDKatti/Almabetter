/* Write a JavaScript program to compare Left Shift(s) and Right Shift(s) to see if they are equal.
If it does, output "YES", otherwise output "NO".

Left Shift (L): Moves all characters in the string one step to the left, 
            placing the first character at the end.
Right Shift (R): Moves all characters in the string one step to the right, 
            placing the last character at the beginning. */


/* Example 2:
Input:
s = "abcd"
            
Output:
NO
            
Explanation:
For s = "abcd", the left shift yields "bcda" and the right shift yields "dabc", which are different. 
Thus, there is no V for which both shifts yield S.
