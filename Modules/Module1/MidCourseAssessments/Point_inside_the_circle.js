/* write a function that takes the circle's center coordinates, radius, and a point's coordinates as input. 
It should return true if the point lies strictly inside the circle and false otherwise. */

/* Example 1:
Input:
Center of the circle: (0, 0)
Radius of circle: 5
Point inside the circle: (2, 2)

Output:
true

Explanation:
The distance between the point (2, 2) and the circle's center (0, 0) is less than the radius 5. 
Therefore, the point lies strictly inside the circle. */
