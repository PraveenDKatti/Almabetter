/* write a function that takes two integers and returns their XOR result without using the XOR operator. */

/* Example 1:
Input:
x = 1
y = 2

Output:
3

Explanation:
The binary representations are:
x = 1 → 01
y = 2 → 10

The XOR operation without using ^ would produce 11 in binary, which equals 3 in decimal. */
