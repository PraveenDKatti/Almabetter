/* Calculate and return the area of triangle using Heron’s formula. The function should return 
the area of the triangle as a floating-point number. */

/* Example 1:
Input:
side1 = 5, side2 = 6, side3 = 7

Output:
14.696938456699069

Explanation:
Using Heron's formula, s = (5 + 6 + 7) / 2 = 9.

Then, Area = √(9 * (9 - 5) * (9 - 6) * (9 - 7)) ≈ 14.70. */
